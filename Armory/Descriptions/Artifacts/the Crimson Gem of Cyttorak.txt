The incredible energies of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak can cause anyone that comes in contact with it to transform into Cyttorak's Exemplar, the Juggernaut, a nearly unstoppable individual. The Juggernaut possesses immense strength and stamina, and doesn't need to sleep, eat, drink, or breathe. The single weak spot is the Juggernautâ€™s mind, but to shield him from any mental attacks, his armor's helmet is shielded against virtually all psychic attacks.
