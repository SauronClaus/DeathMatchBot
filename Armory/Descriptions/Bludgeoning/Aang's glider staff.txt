An airbender staff is a wooden stave used primarily by airbenders to augment their bending. An airbender staff can be used like a regular quarterstaff and employed to augment a variety of defensive and offensive airbending maneuvers. As it extends the airbender's reach, a staff can create more powerful gusts of wind due to the longer arm motion used in performing a technique. However, direct physical contact between the staff and an object is discouraged due to the instrument's aforementioned delicacy, as evidenced by Aang's discomfort when Toph used his staff to crack nuts. When spun in front of the body, an airbender staff will help create an air shield capable of deflecting direct firebending attacks. If lifted over the head, the spinning staff will allow for short periods of vertical or hovering flight.
