A socket wrench is a type of wrench (spanner in British English) that inserts into a socket to turn a fastener, typically in the form of a nut or bolt. The most prevalent form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often informally called a ratchet. A ratchet incorporates a reversible ratcheting mechanism which allows the user to pivot the tool back and forth to turn its socket instead of removing and repositioning a wrench to do so.
