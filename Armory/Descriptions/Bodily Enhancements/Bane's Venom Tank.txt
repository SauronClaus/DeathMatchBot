Venom was a highly-addictive compound that was engineered to significantly multiply one's physical strength. The primary effect of the Venom drug is that it enhances strength to low superhuman levels depending on how much is injected into the user. At the maximum healthy amount you can inject into yourself, you are able to lift around 3-4 tons. Bane is ultimately capable of exceeding this limit and able to lift over 4 tons, though not without momentarily losing his sanity. Your speed and reflexes are also superhumanly enhanced with Venom, making you able to run, move, and reach beyond the limits of the finest human athlete. With the use of Venom, your stamina and endurance are greatly enhanced as well. Your durability is heightened sufficiently to shrug off most blunt force trauma, yet youâ€™re not completely bulletproof. Bane, while using Venom, can withstand blows from most superhumans, withstand falls from great heights, and possibly more.
