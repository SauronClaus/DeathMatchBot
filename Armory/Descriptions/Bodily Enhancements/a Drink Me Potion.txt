'Drink Me' potion is a magical liquid in Wonderland that has an unusual effect to make the drinker shrink in size. Alice drinks every last drop of the bottle's liquid and finds that it tastes absolutely delicious (it had a flavor of cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast, all mixed up). She then finds herself shrinking down to only ten inches high after drinking from the bottle.
