Thermal detonators were palm-sized, spherical devices that were used as extremely deadly explosive weapons. In addition to being surprisingly powerful for their size, they could only be turned off by whoever turned them on. And they would go off only when they were activated, therefore they were very resistant and secure when carrying them.
