The Hadoken ("Surge Fist" or "Wave Motion Fist") is a special attack that originated in Street Fighter. It is often referred to as a "fireball" due to its appearance, despite few instances of the move actually producing flames. It is one of the most famous special moves in the Street Fighter series, along with the Shoryuken, Tatsumaki, and the Shun Goku Satsu.
