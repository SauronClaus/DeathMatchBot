Toon Force is an ability quite similar to Reality Warping only that is typically for comedic effect. It is the ability to replace or apply absurd laws of the universe; the user gains the ability to bend to or even outright overhaul the traditional laws of physics and reality itself at will to create those that are much more lenient in what can and cannot happen
