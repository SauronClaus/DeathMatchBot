Shazam gifted Billy Batson (Captain Marvel) with the power of six legendary Greek/Judaic figures when he spoke the Wizard's name, transforming into an adult superhero. Later, Captain Marvel would gain the ability to share his power with Mary Marvel and Captain Marvel Jr., creating the Marvel Family. Today, Captain Marvel remains as one of the world's greatest heroes.
