This massive Double-Edged Sword was Thanos' primary weapon during his days as a warlord. Other than a melee weapon, it could also be used as a throwing weapon that returned back to Thanos like a boomerang. The sword was made from an extremely sturdy material, being durable enough to withstand strikes from both Stormbreaker and Mj√∏lnir. It was able to break through Vibranium, having shattered Captain America's shield after repeatedly striking it.
