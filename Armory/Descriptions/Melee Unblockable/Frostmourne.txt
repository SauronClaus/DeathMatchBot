Frostmourne was the fearsome, rune-inscribed two-handed longsword of the Lich King. The runeblade originally belonged to Ner'zhul, who thrust it from the Frozen Throne, waiting for young Arthas Menethil to discover it on the continent of Northrend. It was wielded by Arthas until it was destroyed by Tirion Fordring. No one knew where the remnants of Frostmourne and its battered hilt were, until a frost death knight gathered the shards of the sword during the third invasion of the Legion to reforge them into two new powerful runeblades, Icebringer and Frostreaper, the Blades of the Fallen Prince.
