"Vorpal sword" and "vorpal blade" are phrases in Lewis Carroll's 1871 nonsense poem "Jabberwocky", which have been taken up in several other media. Carroll never provided a definition of what the term really meant. It has been adopted by the roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons, where "vorpal" blades have the ability to decapitate opponents on lucky strikes.
