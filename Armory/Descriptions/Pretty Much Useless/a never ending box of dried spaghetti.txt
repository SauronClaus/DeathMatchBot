Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical noodle pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina. A never ending box of dried spaghetti is a small rectangular box that can produce an unlimited supply of dried spaghetti; when a piece of spaghetti is removed from the box, it is immediately replinished.
