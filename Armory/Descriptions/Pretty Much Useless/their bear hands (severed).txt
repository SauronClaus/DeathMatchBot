Bears are renowned for having big sharp claws and are often sensationalized in movies, magazines, and books as using those claws primarily as a weapon to savagely rip apart anything that gets in their way. In reality though, bears use their claws for a wide variety of purposes, many of which are not quite so dramatic. A bear’s paw is incredibly dexterous, and they can use their claws much like we humans use our fingers, that is, for a wide variety of finely detailed tasks. Bears can do things like delicately pick up and manipulate small food items and skin fish with great precision. Bear claws are also designed for activities such as digging…and lots of it! Bears dig holes to bury portions of food that they find or kill to eat later…known as a bear food cache…they tear up the ground looking for roots and rodents, and they also move tons of dirt while preparing their winter dens. In a similar manner, bears use their claws to rip open tree stumps to look for insects to eat as well as digging around on beaches and other areas where a potential meal may be buried. Their bear hands (severed) is a pair of bear hands, severed and placed in front of them.
