The DT-29 heavy blaster pistol was a heavy blaster pistol that saw use during the reign of the Galactic Empire in the hands of Director Orson Krennic, who used a non-regulation DT-29 custom-fitted with a macroscope. Unlike most blasters, it had to be manually reloaded with energy packs which contained six rounds. The DT-29 was designed to excel in dealing heavy damage in exchange for low ammo and continuous reloading.
