The lightsaber rifle was a type of rifle designed to work in conjunction with a standard lightsaber. Once a lightsaber was properly loaded into an open slot on top of the rifle, a lightsaber rifle could produce an overwhelmingly powerful and destructive beam of energy. One such rifle was kept secure in the Jedi Archives. The weapon could fire at least five shots before the lightsaber being used as fuel melted beyond usage, at which point the empty rifle began to smoke. It can also be activated to self-destruct with enough force to break open a large hole in the Jedi Temple wall.
