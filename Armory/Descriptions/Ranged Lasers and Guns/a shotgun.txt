A shotgun (also known as a scattergun, or historically as a fowling piece) is a long-barreled firearm designed to shoot a straight-walled cartridge known as a shotshell, which usually discharges numerous small spherical pellet-like sub-projectiles called shots, or sometimes a single solid projectile called slug. Shotguns are most commonly smoothbore firearms, meaning that their gun barrels have no riflings on the inner wall, but rifled barrels for shooting slugs (slug barrels) are also available.
