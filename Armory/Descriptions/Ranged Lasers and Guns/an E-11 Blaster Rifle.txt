The E-11 blaster rifle was a light but powerful blaster rifle manufactured by BlasTech Industries. It served as the standard issue weapon of Imperial stormtroopers. The blaster rifle was the successor to BlasTech's E-10 blaster rifle and was based on the DC-15A blaster carbine used by clone troopers during the Clone Wars.
