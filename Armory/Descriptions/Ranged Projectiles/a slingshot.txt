A slingshot (US) or catapult (UK), ging (primarily Australian and New Zealand), gulel (India), shanghai (Australian and New Zealand), or kettie (South Africa) is normally a small hand-powered projectile weapon. The classic form consists of a Y-shaped frame held in the off hand (non-dominant hand), with two natural-rubber strips attached to the uprights. The other ends of the strips lead back to a pocket that holds the projectile. The non dominant hand grasps the pocket and draws it back to the desired extent to provide power for the projectileâ€”up to a full span of the arm with sufficiently long bands.
