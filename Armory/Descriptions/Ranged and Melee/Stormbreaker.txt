Like Mjølnir before it, Stormbreaker will return to Thor's hand when summoned and strikes his opponents with massive force. It can glow with an otherworldly blue flame that crackles with electricity and seems to have the ability to home in on a target if Thor wills it. In addition, the weapon allows the user to fly effortlessly while using it, unlike Mjølnir, which required the user to spin it at great speed to lift them off the ground. Unlike Mjølnir, however, the weapon is not enchanted to prevent those deemed "unworthy" from holding it, making anybody with sufficient strength capable of using the weapon.[1] Stormbreaker can also be summoned by those worthy of lifting Mjølnir, as shown when Captain America, who was previously proven worthy of wielding the hammer in his fight against past Thanos, summoned Stormbreaker by mistake some moments later during the Battle of Earth. Due to its increased size and mass, having both the blade of an axe and the head of a hammer in its construction, as well as sporting an elongated handle enabling the weapon to be wielded two-handed, it is a notably more potent melee weapon than Mjølnir. Eitri even went as far as to say Stormbreaker was meant to be the strongest weapon in Asgard's history. As such, it is one of the few able to grievously wound Thanos, who faced off against the combined might of Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Drax, Star-Lord, Mantis, and Nebula while suffering nothing more than a tiny scratch on the cheek. Thanos himself mocked Thor for not aiming for his head, indicating Stormbreaker would have been capable of killing him instantly. Being built to stand against the Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Mad Titan, Eitri enchanted it with several properties that allowed it to take advantage of the weaknesses Eitri had installed into the Gauntlet in order to overpower it, quickly slicing through the beam unleashed by Thanos, although that time Thanos was caught off-guard and could have repelled the attack by other means.
