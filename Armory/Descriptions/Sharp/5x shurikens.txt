A shuriken is a Japanese concealed weapon that was used as a hidden dagger or metsubushi to distract or misdirect. They are also known as throwing stars, or ninja stars, although they were originally designed in many different shapes. Contrary to this nomenclature, the shuriken (ninja stars) were not in the arsenal of those who practised ninjutsu. Modern movies and tales portray ninjas using shuriken, but they were mainly used by samurai and ashigaru soldiers. The major varieties of shuriken are the bo shuriken and the hira shuriken or shaken.
