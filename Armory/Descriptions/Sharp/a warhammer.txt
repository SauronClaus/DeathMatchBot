A war hammer was a long-handled weapon used by foot-soldiers, especially in the defense of fortified walls and in action against mounted men-at-arms. It is a very ancient weapon and gave its name, owing to its constant use, to one of the rulers of France. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the war hammer became an elaborately decorated and handsome weapon.
