Shelob's Lair, also known as Torech Ungol, was located in the pass of Cirith Ungol and served as an impassable labyrinth in which to ensnare the enemies of Mordor. It was also home to Shelob. he lair itself was at the utmost top of a dangerous staircase and was shrouded in shadow and darkness. The tunnel walls themselves were smooth, as if worn by immeasurable touching. It was wide enough for Frodo and Sam to walk side by side with their outstretched hands touching the side walls. Inside were the skeletons and rotting corpses of Shelob's past prey; deeper into the cave could be found sticky, innumberable webs in a vast maze of tunnels.
