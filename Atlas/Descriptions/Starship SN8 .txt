The SpaceX Starship system is a proposed fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX. The system is composed of a booster stage, named Super Heavy, and a second stage, also referred to as "Starship". The second stage is being designed as a long-duration cargo, and eventually, passenger-carrying spacecraft. The spacecraft will serve as both the second stage and the in-space long-duration orbital spaceship. Engine development started in 2012, and Starship development began in 2016 as a self-funded private spaceflight project. Testing of the second stage Starship began in 2019 as part of an extensive development program to prove out launch-and-landing and iterate on a variety of design details, particularly with respect to the vehicle's atmospheric reentry. Integrated system testing of a proof of concept for the second stage began in March 2019 with a prototype nicknamed Starhopper, which made low-altitude, low-velocity flight testing of vertical launches and landings. This was followed by two additional full-size tank prototype versions (SN5 and SN6), which also made low-altitude test flights in August and September 2020. On 9 December 2020, Starship prototype SN8 performed the first high-altitude test flight, demonstrating most of the atmospheric re-entry maneuvers. The test was deemed a success, although a hard landing caused the explosion of the prototype. More prototype Starships have been built and more are under construction as the iterative design progresses. All test articles have a 9 m (30 ft)-diameter stainless steel hull.
