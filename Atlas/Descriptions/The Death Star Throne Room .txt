The Emperor's throne room on the first Death Star was located in an observation dome at the top of a tower placed directly next to the station's superlaser. The platform served as Palpatine's watchtower in order to view the laser's firing demonstrations. The Emperor's chamber could only be reached through a massive circular doorway with a large metal beam that rotated to unlock the door. In the main chamber, the Emperor's throne was elevated above the floor by a short staircase and flanked by his Royal Guards and Imperial Senate Guards. There were numerous control consoles surrounding Palpatine's throne, and the room was decorated with large statues made of black stone.
