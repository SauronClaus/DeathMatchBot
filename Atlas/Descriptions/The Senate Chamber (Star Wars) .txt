The Galactic Senate Chamber, also known as the Grand Convocation Chamber, the Senate Rotunda, or simply as the Senate Chamber was a large, open area contained within the Senate Building on the planet Coruscant. The chamber was the meeting hall for the Galactic Senate of the Galactic Republic and the center of political activity. It was lined with 1,024 repulsorpods for the senators and representatives from the various political delegations, with some delegations, such as the Naboo delegation, having their own pod, while other representatives had to share. The platforms could detach from the walls of the chamber which was equipped with voice-amplifying microphones, translators, and hovercams that recorded the various proceedings. At the center of the chamber was the Chancellor's podium, itself extended from the "working office" of the Chancellery Secretariat, where the Supreme Chancellor and the Vice Chair would preside over meetings of the Senate. It was in the Galactic Senate Chamber that Chancellor Sheev Palpatine proclaimed the formation of the Galactic Empire with himself as emperor in front of the newly christened Imperial Senate. Many of the repulsorpods were later damaged when Sidious and Jedi Master Yoda threw them at each other while dueling. The Chamber held 1,024 delegations from the worlds of the Republic.
