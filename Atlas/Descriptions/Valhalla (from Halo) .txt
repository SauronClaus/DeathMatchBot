Valhalla (Riverworld in Halo Online) is a multiplayer map in Halo 3. The map itself is a sparsely forested valley with mountains in the distance, featuring a stream, rocky outcroppings, and large hills. It is said to be a "spinoff of the Blood Gulch map from Halo: Combat Evolved." Valhalla was remade for Halo 4 as Ragnarok.
