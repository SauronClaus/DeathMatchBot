Whoville (alternatively spelled Who-ville) is the central location on the Dr. Seuss television special, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! -- The Grinch lives high above them with his dog Max on Mount Crumpit, watching them frequently. The inhabitants of this place are the Whos, very few of whom are named. One of the only differences among them is their size, ranging from small to large. In Halloween is Grinch Night, the Grinch also comes down on Grinch Night/Halloween, which happens in autumn when the "sour-sweet wind is in the air, the Gree-Grumps growl, the Hakken-Krakks yowl, and everyone knows to stay indoors, for the Grinch will be coming down from Mount Crumpit in his "paraphernalia wagon". The only thing that stopped the Grinch on Grinch Night was young Euchariah Who.
