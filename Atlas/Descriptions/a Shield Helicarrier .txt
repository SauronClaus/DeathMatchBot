Helicarriers are advanced flying command centers that double as aircraft carriers. Specifically, Helicarriers were designed to be capable of sustained, independently-powered flight, via four, massive turbine engines that provide the lift needed to keep them in the air, though they were able to retain seaborne capabilities. Their technology was created, in part, with designs by Howard Stark.
