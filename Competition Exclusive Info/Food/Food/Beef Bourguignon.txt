Beef bourguignon is a beef stew braised in red wine, often red Burgundy, and beef stock, typically flavored with carrots, onions, garlic, and a bouquet garni, and garnished with pearl onions, mushrooms, and bacon. It is also a dish consisting of a piece of braised beef with the same garnish, at which point it may be called piece de boeuf a la bourguignonne.
