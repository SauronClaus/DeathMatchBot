"Alright, I've been thinking. When life gives you lemons don't make lemonade, make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your lemons, what am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager. Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons. Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down. With the lemons. I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!" -Cave Johnson
