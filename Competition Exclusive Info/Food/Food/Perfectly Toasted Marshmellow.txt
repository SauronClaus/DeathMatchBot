Marshmallow is a type of confectionery that is typically made from sugar, water and gelatin whipped to a solid but soft consistency. It is used as a filling in baking, or commonly molded into shapes and coated with corn starch. It is the modern version of a medicinal confection made from Althaea officinalis, the marshmallow plant.
