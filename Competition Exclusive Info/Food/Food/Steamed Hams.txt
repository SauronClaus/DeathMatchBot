Steamed Hams is a meme based on the Season 7 episode "22 Short Films About Springfield". The unedited version is the segment of Seymour Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers. People make parodies of the scene such as subverting the genre or adding a twist to the events or just making a YouTube Poop and SiIvaGunner rips out of it, and in fact, someone even made a Hit & Run level, An Unforgettable Luncheon, out of it. A clip of this short also appeared in the "Bart's Not Dead" couch gag celebrating 30 years of The Simpsons.
