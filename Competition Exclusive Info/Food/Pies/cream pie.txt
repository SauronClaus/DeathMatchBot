A cream pie is a type of pie filled with a rich custard or pudding that is made from milk, cream, sugar, wheat flour, and eggs. It comes in many forms, including vanilla, lemon, lime, peanut butter, banana, coconut, and chocolate. One feature of most cream pies is a whipped cream topping. The custard filling is related to crème patissière, a key component of French cakes and tarts. It is a one-crust pie, where the crust covers the bottoms and sides but not the top. The crust may be a standard pie crust made with crumbled cookies or a graham cracker crust for savory pies.
