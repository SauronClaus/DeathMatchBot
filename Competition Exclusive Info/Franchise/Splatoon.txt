Splatoon is a Japanese third-person shooter video game franchise created by Hisashi Nogami, and developed and owned by Nintendo. The series features fictional, anthropomorphic, cephalopodic characters known as Inklings and Octolings, based on squids and octopus respectively, that transform between humanoid and cephalopod forms at will. They frequently engage in turf wars with each other and use a variety of weapons that produce and shoot colored ink while in humanoid form, or swim and hide in surfaces covered in their own colored ink while in cephalopodic form.
