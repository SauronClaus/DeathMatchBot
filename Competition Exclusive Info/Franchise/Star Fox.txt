Star Fox is a spaceship shooter video game series created by Nintendo. The games follow a combat team of anthropomorphic animals called Star Fox, led by chief protagonist Fox McCloud. Gameplay involves adventures around the Lylat planetary system in the futuristic "Arwing" fighter aircraft, in other vehicles and on foot. The original Star Fox (1993) was a forward-scrolling 3D rail shooter, though later titles added more directional freedom.
