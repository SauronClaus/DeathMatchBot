According to legend, Agamotto emerged from the tear of Oshtur, benevolent Elder Goddess of Earth, as she was moved by the unyielding joy of a blind boy, circa 25,000 BC, though it is now known that Agamotto was already an adult and the Sorcerer Supreme during the Stone Age, in 1,000,000 BC. He was born a mortal (but not a human).
