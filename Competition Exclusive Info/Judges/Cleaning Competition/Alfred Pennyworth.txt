Alfred Pennyworth is the trusted butler of Bruce Wayne and the Wayne Family, making him Batman's manservant.

His responsibilities include attending to Batman and making sure he can properly function, as well as looking after the Batcave and Wayne Manor. Always the perfect gentleman, Alfred is loyal and faithful, although not afraid to criticize his employer when he deserves it. His experience in the military has given him combat and medical training, and he was also a noted stage actor in his time. He is an important member of the Batman Family and has been the leader of the Outsiders. Alfred first appeared in Batman #16 (1943), by Don Cameron and Bob Kane.
