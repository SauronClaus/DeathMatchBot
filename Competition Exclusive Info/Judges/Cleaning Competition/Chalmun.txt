Chalmun was a male Wookiee and the owner of Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina in Mos Eisley, Tatooine. Originally a street fighter, he swindled tourists on Ord Mantell until he had enough money to buy his cantina from the Vriichon brothers. Despite his desire to enforce certain rules, his establishment was known for its occasional outbreaks of shocking violence, and even Chalmun himself had shady dealings with local gangsters.
