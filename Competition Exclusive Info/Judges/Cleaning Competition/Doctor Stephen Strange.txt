Dr. Stephen Strange, M.D., aka Doctor Strange was the Sorcerer Supreme for Earth-616. Strange was once a brilliant but arrogant, neurosurgeon, until a car accident crippled his hands. When modern medicine failed him, he embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj in Tibet, where he was trained by the Ancient One. He healed his hands and learned more about Magic, eventually becoming a Master of the Mystic Arts. He settled in the Sanctum Sanctorum in Greenwich Village, New York City, becoming the Earth's protector from any mystical threats.
