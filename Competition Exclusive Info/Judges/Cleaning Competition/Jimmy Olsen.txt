James Bartholomew "Jimmy" Olsen is well recognized as Superman's best pal. He is an investigative reporter and photo-journalist, formerly a copy-boy, working at the Daily Planet since his teenage years. His closest friends and co-workers are Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Perry White. Olsen has no consistent superpowers of his own, but he is frequently put into situations where he develops bizarre transformations or mutations allowing him to develop weird special abilities. Superman has given him a Signal Watch to call on in case he is ever in danger and needs help. He has been a member of Project Cadmus and the Legion of Super-Heroes. Jimmy Olsen was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster as an unnamed office-boy, first appearing in Action Comics #6. (1938) He was later named and fleshed out in the The Adventures of Superman radio show (1940), and those additions were brought back into the comics in Superman #13 (1941).
