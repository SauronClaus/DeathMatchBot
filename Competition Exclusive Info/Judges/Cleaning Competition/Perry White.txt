Perry White is the editor-in-chief at the Daily Planet and a close friend and ally of Superman. He works alongside Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. White has lived in Metropolis his entire life, growing up in the rough neighborhood Suicide Slum. His strength and integrity have led him to be one of the world's greatest journalists, and underneath his leadership the Planet hasn't missed a single issue through crisis after crisis. Despite his tough-mindedness and grouchy personality, he has always been a kind and fair boss. Perry is married to Alice White, and he has had two children Jerry White and Keith White. Perry White was created for the The Adventures of Superman radio show (February 1940), and then was introduced into comics by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster shortly afterward, first appearing in Superman #7. (November 1940)
