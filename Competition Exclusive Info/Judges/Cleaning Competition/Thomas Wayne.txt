Thomas Wayne is a famous surgeon and wealthy philanthropist in Gotham City. His father is industrialist Patrick Wayne, his wife is socialite Martha Kane, and his son is millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. The Waynes were murdered by a mugger in Crime Alley, leaving their son orphaned. This inspired Bruce to train and become the vigilante super-hero Batman. There have been several figures implicated in these murders including Joe Chill, Lew Moxon and the Court of Owls. Thomas Wayne was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, first appearing in Detective Comics #33. (1939)
