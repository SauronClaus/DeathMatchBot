Wong was the descendant and look-alike of Kan, a Tibetan monk who lived roughly one thousand years ago and was a student of the occult. For the ten generations preceding Wong's, the first-born males in his line have served the Ancient One, the former Sorcerer Supreme of the Earth dimension. The last of the members of Wong's family to serve the Ancient One was Wong's own father, Hamir the Hermit, who remained with the Ancient One up to the time of the latter's death.
