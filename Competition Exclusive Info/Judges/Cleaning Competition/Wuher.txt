Wuher was a human male from Tatooine who worked as a bartender at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. Having lost his parents to battle droids during the Clone Wars, he strongly disliked droids and installed a droid detector in the cantina to keep them out. Despite this, Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi entered with the droids C-3PO and R2-D2. Upon noticing their presence, he ordered that the droids would have to wait outside because he didn't serve their kind.
