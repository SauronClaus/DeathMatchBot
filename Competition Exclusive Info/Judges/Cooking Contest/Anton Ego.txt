Ego is an imperious and acerbic food critic, whose reviews have been known to ruin restaurants. He strongly objected to Gusteau's belief that anyone can cook, and was a firm critic of the idealist chef. Upon disliking the cooking, Ego gave Gusteau's restaurant a harsh review, causing it to lose one of its five stars. Gusteau died of a broken heart shortly after, which lost the restaurant another star. In his review, he compared Chef Gusteau to the Italian-American chef Chef Boyardee, another well-known and respected chef who became a frozen food mascot after his passing.
