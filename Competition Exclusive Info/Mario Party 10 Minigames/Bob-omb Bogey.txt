Each player has to swing a golf club and hit golf balls. The faster the player hits the ball (if they even hit the ball), the more points they will get. First gets fifty points, second gets thirty, third gets twenty, and fourth gets ten. If a player hits a Bob-omb, they will lose fifty points. The minigame ends when ten balls are hit (not counting Bob-ombs), and whoever has the most points wins the minigame.
