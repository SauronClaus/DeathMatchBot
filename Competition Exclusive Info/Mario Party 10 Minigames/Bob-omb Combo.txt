The players are in a factory setting with 80 Bob-ombs moving around. The objective is to detonate as many Bob-ombs as possible by using a single Bob-omb to throw (which can be tricky, since the players have only one round each). The player has ten seconds to throw their Bob-omb; once they do, a chain reaction occurs depending on the number of Bob-ombs in a certain area. Once all players have made their moves, the player who detonated the most Bob-ombs wins.
