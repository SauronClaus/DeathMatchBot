The players are standing on a bridge in Sparkling Waters and they jump on a Super Star that makes them invincible. In this state, the players cannot harm each other and must defeat as many Cheep Cheeps as they can. Cheep Cheeps come in large groups and the player must jump to reach them. There are two other types of Cheep Cheeps that appear: while normal Cheep Cheeps are worth one point, Big Cheep Cheeps are worth two and Gold Cheep Cheeps are worth three. After thirty seconds, the players lose their invincibility and the minigame ends. The player with most points wins.
