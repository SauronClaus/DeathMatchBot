The players are in a temple, stuck inside. Each player must use the available Dice Block to enter the code of a Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Green Shell in no particular order. Each time the player hits an icon that matches, the dice will roll faster. If any player rolls a Bowser icon, the door is reset. If a player rolls any icon they have already rolled, they have to try again. The first player to successfully open the door by matching all three icons wins.
