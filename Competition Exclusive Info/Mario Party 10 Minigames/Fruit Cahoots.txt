The players are at a conveyor belt with apples and Bob-ombs. They must either press a button, or not press it. If they do, the conveyor moves forward on their behalf or not. The players either receives an apple (which is one point), three apples (which is three points), or Bob-ombs (which deduct one point). Once the screen reads "0", the players get whatever they have in front of them. After 7 rounds, the player that has the most points wins the minigame.
