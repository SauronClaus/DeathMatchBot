The playing area consists of 16 stone-head pillars arranged in a 4x4 manner. At the start of the minigame, the players are standing on the most external pillars. Fruits of various kind will drop onto random Stone-Eyes, including apples, watermelons, bananas, melons and grapes. The players must jump from pillar to pillar – this is done by simply pressing a direction on the + Control Pad – to reach the fruit, each granting them one point. Occasionally, three fruits of the same kind appear on one single pillar, worthing 3 points. If two players try to jump on the same pillar, they'll hit each other and return to the pillar where they jumped from. After 30 seconds, the minigame ends. The character with the most points wins.
