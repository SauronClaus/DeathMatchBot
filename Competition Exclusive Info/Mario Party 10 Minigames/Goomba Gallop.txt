The players are in a springtime forest setting, with Goombas, Galoombas, and Goombrats. The objective is to find out which of the three types of Goombas have the biggest group. A number of these types of Goombas will move across, eventually disappearing at the bottom of the screen. Once the horde of Goombas passes, the players must all choose which type of Goomba ended up having the largest group. Players who answer incorrectly are yielded zero points, while the first player to answer correctly gets five points, the second player to do so gets three points, the third player gets two points, and the fourth player gets one point. After two rounds, the player with the most points wins. Goombas generally move forward, Goombrats move in a zig-zag fashion and Galoombas move in a curved manner. During the first round, the camera is positioned in front of the Goombas, but in the second round, it is to the diagonal side of the Goombas. Occasionally, in the first round, a Goomba will occasionally trip and fall, then get up and continue walking, and in the second round, a Waddlewing will glide and obscure the players' view for half a second.
