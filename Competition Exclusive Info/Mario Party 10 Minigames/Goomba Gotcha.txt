Players have to select as many Goombas, Galoombas, or Goombrats as possible. Before the game begins, one player chooses what enemy players should select in the game. Each time a player picks the right enemy, they earn a point. Should a player choose a wrong enemy, they lose a point. The player with the most points in the end wins.
