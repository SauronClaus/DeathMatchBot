The players are in a volcanic area that has platforms that constantly sink and rise. The objective is to get off the sinking platforms and get on the rising platforms, while at the same time try to push the other players off. As the time rolls by, less platforms will appear and will remain risen for less time. If all but one player falls into the lava, then that player wins. If there are still surviving players when the time runs out, then those players tie for first place.
