The minigame is set in a library, and has a podium in the middle, with a color wheel consisting of twelve colors. The enemies that appear are a Shy Guy, a Fuzzy, an Urchin, a Hammer Bro., a Bullet Bill, a Koopa Troopa, a Dry Bones, a Blooper, a Huckit Crab, a Waddlewing, a Goomba, a Cheep Cheep, a Boo, a Goombrat, and a Bob-omb, which makes fifteen enemies. The objective is to remember the colors the enemies are on, and drag them to their appropriate color. The order of play is randomly decided. If a player brings an enemy to the appropriate color, they make it to the next round; otherwise, they are eliminated. The last player standing wins. If no one drags an enemy within the time limit, they are all eliminated and the game is a draw.
