The players are located in a field with six elevated platforms. A random layout is generated each time this minigame is played. The objective of the game is to shoot opponents and be the last player standing, or to have the most hearts when the time expires. If a player is shot three times, they are considered out and a Lakitu drags them away. The last player standing, or the player with the most hearts after 30 seconds have passed, wins.
