The Shy Guys (as the name implies) shuffle around, forcing players to pay attention to their position and then the player has to choose the one with the most donuts on his head in order to get the most points. The number of donuts the player chooses is worth the same amount of points as the value of the donuts ranging from one to five. After three rounds, the character with the highest score wins the minigame.
