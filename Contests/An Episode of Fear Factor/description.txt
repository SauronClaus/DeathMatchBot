Fear Factor was an American stunt/dare game show that first aired on NBC from 2001 to 2006 and was initially hosted by comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan. In this variant, the competitors must complete three stunts- rather than any monetary prize, the prize is the victory in the competition. The three rounds are Beat the Beast, Face Your Fear, and The Final Fear (all from the 2017 MTV revival of the show).
