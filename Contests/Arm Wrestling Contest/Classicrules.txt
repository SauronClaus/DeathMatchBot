Each match is officiated by two referees, one on each side so the officials can see the competitors and their grip from both sides.
There is no time limit to a match but a referee may call a halt to the match.
The competitors should approach the table, make themselves comfortable and then grip their opponent's hand. The grip should be palm to palm with the thumb knuckle visible.
Once the referees are happy with the grip from both competitors, the contest will begin. Each competitor should attempt to pin their opponent’s arm onto the touch pad.
Pressure should be in a sideways capacity to force their opponent's hand to the touch pad. Back pressure in an attempt to drag the opponent off toward the centre of the table is not allowed.
The match is won when one competitor pins their opponent’s hand onto the touch pad.
A valid pin is when any part of the competitors natural wrist touches the touch pad.
