In professional boxing, bouts take place over 12 three minute rounds with one minute rest between rounds.
The only method of attack is punching with a clenched fist and you may not strike below the belt, in the kidneys or the back of your opponents head or neck.
You cannot hit an opponent when they are down.
A boxer hit with a low blow can take five minutes to recover.
If an unintentional foul (such as a clash of heads) ends the fight before four rounds are completed this is a "no contest", from the fifth onwards the decision goes to the judgeâ€™s cards and is either a technical decision for either fighter or a technical draw.
