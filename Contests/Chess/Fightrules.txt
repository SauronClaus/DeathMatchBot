Interference with opponents is permitted.
Each competitor must follow all the rules of Chess.
If the opponent is knocked out or unable to continue, it's a stalemate; victory is only accomplished via checkmate.
Assume that both competitors magically know and can follow the rules of Chess, but beyond that have no special proficiency in Chess.
