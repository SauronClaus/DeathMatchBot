Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. Played by millions of people worldwide, chess is believed to be derived from the Indian game chaturanga sometime before the 7th century. Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the East Asian strategy games xiangqi (Chinese chess), janggi (Korean chess), and shogi (Japanese chess). Chess reached Europe via Persia and Arabia by the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The queen and bishop assumed their current movements in the Kingdom of Valencia (modern Spain) in the late 15th century, and the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century.
