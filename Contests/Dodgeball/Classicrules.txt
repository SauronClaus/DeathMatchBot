Neither competitor may pass over the half-court line.
The only weapon allowed is dodgeballs.
A competitor is out if they are hit with the ball and fail to catch it before it hits the floor, if a ball thrown by them is caught, or if they hit their opponent in the head.
If a competitor manages to score a basket on the opponent's basketball hoop, they win.
Competitors may use dodgeballs to block other dodgeballs.
