A competition to see who can hold his liquor better. In its simplest form, participants drink equal amounts simultaneously and whoever quits, vomits or passes out first, loses. Variants may involve periodic tests of skill, often with the loser obliged to perform some humiliating forfeit. The winner is the first person to either conceed, fall unconcious, or fail to be able to drink any more.
