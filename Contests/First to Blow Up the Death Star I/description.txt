The first person to blow up the Death Star I in an X-wing starfighter is victorius. Neither competitor may attack the other one, and both competitiors have assistance in the form of the starships used in the Battle of Yavin (minus the Millennium Falcon and Luke Skywalker). In case of both fighters failing, both fighters try again, starting at the beginning of the battle with memories of all previous runs.
