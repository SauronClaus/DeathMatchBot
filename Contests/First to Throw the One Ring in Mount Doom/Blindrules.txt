The person appears at Frodo Baggin's house in the Shire as Frodo prepares to leave.
The person has not read the Lord of the Rings book series; if this would cause a significant life change, they instead simply forget the contents of the books and any film adaptations.
In case of death, the person starts over from the beginning of the run with their memories intact.
No interference with opponent's run is allowed or even possible.
Nobody recognizes or will give special assistance to any famous people.
The person magically has the One Ring, and has a Hobbit's natural resistance to the possession of the ring (using Frodo Baggins as a benchmark). 
In order to win, the person must be the one to drop the One Ring into Mount Doom- it counts as invalid if any other character from the books does it.
