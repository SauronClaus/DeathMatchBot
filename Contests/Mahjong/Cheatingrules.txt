No interference with other competitiors is allowed.
Each competitor doesn't need to follow all the rules of Mahjong; but, if caught cheating, they're immediately disqualified.
Assume that both competitors magically know and can follow the rules of Mahjong, but beyond that have no special proficiency in Mahjong.
