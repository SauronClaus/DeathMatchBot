Interference with opponents is permitted.
Each competitor must follow all the rules of Mahjong.
If the opponent is knocked out or unable to continue, it's a stalemate; victory is only accomplished via winning in Mahjong.
Assume that both competitors magically know and can follow the rules of Mahjong, but beyond that have no special proficiency in Mahjong.
