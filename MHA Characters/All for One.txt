All For One (オール・フォー・ワン Ōru Fō Wan?), surname Shigaraki (死柄木 Shigaraki?), is the overarching antagonist of the My Hero Academia manga and anime series. He was the founder and benefactor of the League of Villains. Once Japan's most powerful villain, and All Might's arch-nemesis, his full identity is unknown. His ultimate goal was to steal One For All, the Quirk that originally belonged to his younger twin brother, the only Quirk that can oppose him. He was the mentor of Tomura Shigaraki, having spent the young villain's life shaping him into a successor, and a vessel for his power in a plan to eventually conquer the world as a self-proclaimed "demon lord".
